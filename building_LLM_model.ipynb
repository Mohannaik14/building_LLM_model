Inflation eased, the labor market cooled, a war broke out and banks failed, yet the Fed pushed rates higher; despite lower confidence and higher borrowing costs, the U.S. consumer kept consuming; growth equities outperformed value, though stretched valuations and rising rates should have encouraged the opposite; and the international recovery has been fragmented despite China finally emerging from the pandemic.\n",

While tighter lending standards, weaker job gains and lower savings should result in some “belt tightening,” a recession may once again be avoided. Some of this economic optimism can be attributed to growing confidence that the U.S. has already pushed through peak rates, with the Fed likely finished hiking. A lower Federal Funds Rate should translate into lower borrowing costs more broadly, providing a reprieve to indebted Americans. Meanwhile, the international economic laggards of 2023, like China and Europe, should accelerate through 2024 as other economies gradually lose steam, resulting in less divergence across global growth.

Meanwhile, interest in non-U.S. stocks has increased since the beginning of the year, albeit mostly through passive vehicles, with investor allocations trending higher than the historical average despite a hazy geopolitical horizon.

And while that is likely to fade, there are still likely to be some stings in the tail in coming months. After a summer of very low core inﬂation readings in the US of 0.2%mom, monthly inﬂation numbers are likely to print somewhat higher in coming months. Moreover, if the economy does not slow as we expect, the prospect of one or two additional Fed hikes could mean that we enter 2024 with monetary policy still a source of higher rate volatility rather than a driver of lower growth volatility. After the experience of 2022, policymakers may also respond more quickly and more hawkishly to commodity price shocks in the context of a strong labour market, even if they are caused by escalating geopolitical risks. Even without an escalation of those risks, a robust global economy is likely to highlight supply constraints in parts of the commodity complex, although there is at least some scope for a relaxation in the oil market where supply restraint is explicitly engineered. While the year ahead does hold out the prospect of a friendlier policy mix, when it turns and how friendly it becomes will depend on the degree and speed with which inﬂation actually slows. \n",

With strong household balance sheets and solid real income growth, those rates are proving more manageable than expected. Japan is unique also in being the place where we expect policy rate hikes to begin rather than to end in 2024 and, like the US, it may be “escaping” to an earlier era. In other places, the risks seem larger. While we expect improving income dynamics to support a better Euro area growth proﬁle in 2024, the economy there has continued to underperform this year, the impact of shocks to energy supply and from China may have a more lasting impact than expected, and worries about the ability to manage a higher rate structure, given this enduring weakness, are not conﬁned to the periphery. China’s growth in 2024 should beneﬁt from additional ﬁscal and monetary stimulus, but it is still struggling with the headwinds from the long property market deleveraging and demographic headwinds. Given prevailing negativity about China’s growth prospects, we could see some upside in local assets if growth surprises on the upside.

This backdrop mitigates the case for material USD weakness, as it has done through most of 2023. The end to the Fed rate hiking cycle and a benign global growth picture tend, all else equal, to weigh on the broad Dollar. But without better-than-expected performance in the other major economies of the kind we saw in late 2022 and early 2023, it is hard to have much conﬁdence in those dynamics. Many of the risks we envisage to our central case also push towards more, rather than less, USD strength. US rate spreads to Europe and many other DM economies are also likely to stay wide, unless US growth underperforms our forecasts.  \n",

First, outside US mega-caps, “earnings yields” look less stretched versus history and in many places valuations have improved relative to last year. Second, for mega-cap tech, 5-year forward earnings yields also look quite reasonable versus forward real bond returns if the expected growth proﬁles can be delivered. Third, parts of the cyclical universe, including energy, offer attractive earnings yields if we are right that the growth proﬁle for each area holds up, since they are implicitly discounting signiﬁcant declines in earnings going forward. Fourth, dispersion is likely to remain high and focus on company “alpha” may continue to be rewarded. It is probably hard for all these arguments to be true simultaneously. Aggregation constraints mean that higher expected growth in the largest US companies may come at the expense of others, implying that their valuations should be lower. We think that in a “higher for longer” world, strong balance sheet companies and larger companies probably still have scope to extend their outperformance on average.

From an asset market standpoint, that is likely to prove a very important shift compared with the past couple of years, where policymakers have been mostly focused on inﬂation risks and the need to tame them.

And while that is likely to fade, there are still likely to be some stings in the tail in coming months. After a summer of very low core inﬂation readings in the US of 0.2%mom, monthly inﬂation numbers are likely to print somewhat higher in coming months. Moreover, if the economy does not slow as we expect, the prospect of one or two additional Fed hikes could mean that we enter 2024 with monetary policy still a source of higher rate volatility rather than a driver of lower growth volatility. After the experience of 2022, policymakers may also respond more quickly and more hawkishly to commodity price shocks in the context of a strong labour market, even if they are caused by escalating geopolitical risks. Even without an escalation of those risks, a robust global economy is likely to highlight supply constraints in parts of the commodity complex, although there is at least some scope for a relaxation in the oil market where supply restraint is explicitly engineered. While the year ahead does hold out the prospect of a friendlier policy mix, when it turns and how friendly it becomes will depend on the degree and speed with which inﬂation actually slows. \n",

With strong household balance sheets and solid real income growth, those rates are proving more manageable than expected. Japan is unique also in being the place where we expect policy rate hikes to begin rather than to end in 2024 and, like the US, it may be “escaping” to an earlier era. In other places, the risks seem larger. While we expect improving income dynamics to support a better Euro area growth proﬁle in 2024, the economy there has continued to underperform this year, the impact of shocks to energy supply and from China may have a more lasting impact than expected, and worries about the ability to manage a higher rate structure, given this enduring weakness, are not conﬁned to the periphery. China’s growth in 2024 should beneﬁt from additional ﬁscal and monetary stimulus, but it is still struggling with the headwinds from the long property market deleveraging and demographic headwinds. Given prevailing negativity about China’s growth prospects, we could see some upside in local assets if growth surprises on the upside.

This backdrop mitigates the case for material USD weakness, as it has done through most of 2023. The end to the Fed rate hiking cycle and a benign global growth picture tend, all else equal, to weigh on the broad Dollar. But without better-than-expected performance in the other major economies of the kind we saw in late 2022 and early 2023, it is hard to have much conﬁdence in those dynamics. Many of the risks we envisage to our central case also push towards more, rather than less, USD strength. US rate spreads to Europe and many other DM economies are also likely to stay wide, unless US growth underperforms our forecasts.  \n",

            "“yields” in some areas and under some conditions. First, outside US mega-caps, “earnings yields” look less stretched versus history and in many places valuations have improved relative to last year. Second, for mega-cap tech, 5-year forward earnings yields also look quite reasonable versus forward real bond returns if the expected growth proﬁles can be delivered. Third, parts of the cyclical universe, including energy, offer attractive earnings yields if we are right that the growth proﬁle for each area holds up, since they are implicitly discounting signiﬁcant declines in earnings going forward. Fourth, dispersion is likely to remain high and focus on company “alpha” may continue to be rewarded. It is probably hard for all these arguments to be true simultaneously. Aggregation constraints mean that higher expected growth in the largest US companies may come at the expense of others, implying that their valuations should be lower. We think that in a “higher for longer” world, strong balance sheet companies and larger companies probably still have scope to extend their outperformance on average. This leaves us favouring a barbell with some exposure to the US mega-caps alongside exposure to some of the more beaten-down cyclical areas. \n",

From an asset market standpoint, that is likely to prove a very important shift compared with the past couple of years, where policymakers have been mostly focused on inﬂation risks and the need to tame them. Even a modestly friendlier Fed should open the door for insurance cuts if we see downside growth shocks and bring a weak version of the “Fed Put” into play.

And while that is likely to fade, there are still likely to be some stings in the tail in coming months. After a summer of very low core inﬂation readings in the US of 0.2%mom, monthly inﬂation numbers are likely to print somewhat higher in coming months. Moreover, if the economy does not slow as we expect, the prospect of one or two additional Fed hikes could mean that we enter 2024 with monetary policy still a source of higher rate volatility rather than a driver of lower growth volatility. After the experience of 2022, policymakers may also respond more quickly and more hawkishly to commodity price shocks in the context of a strong labour market, even if they are caused by escalating geopolitical risks. Even without an escalation of those risks, a robust global economy is likely to highlight supply constraints in parts of the commodity complex, although there is at least some scope for a relaxation in the oil market where supply restraint is explicitly engineered. While the year ahead does hold out the prospect of a friendlier policy mix, when it turns and how friendly it becomes will depend on the degree and speed with which inﬂation actually slows. \n",

With strong household balance sheets and solid real income growth, those rates are proving more manageable than expected. Japan is unique also in being the place where we expect policy rate hikes to begin rather than to end in 2024 and, like the US, it may be “escaping” to an earlier era. In other places, the risks seem larger. While we expect improving income dynamics to support a better Euro area growth proﬁle in 2024, the economy there has continued to underperform this year, the impact of shocks to energy supply and from China may have a more lasting impact than expected, and worries about the ability to manage a higher rate structure, given this enduring weakness, are not conﬁned to the periphery. China’s growth in 2024 should beneﬁt from additional ﬁscal and monetary stimulus, but it is still struggling with the headwinds from the long property market deleveraging and demographic headwinds. Given prevailing negativity about China’s growth prospects, we could see some upside in local assets if growth surprises on the upside.

This backdrop mitigates the case for material USD weakness, as it has done through most of 2023. The end to the Fed rate hiking cycle and a benign global growth picture tend, all else equal, to weigh on the broad Dollar. But without better-than-expected performance in the other major economies of the kind we saw in late 2022 and early 2023, it is hard to have much conﬁdence in those dynamics. Many of the risks we envisage to our central case also push towards more, rather than less, USD strength. US rate spreads to Europe and many other DM economies are also likely to stay wide, unless US growth underperforms our forecasts.  \n",

            "“yields” in some areas and under some conditions. First, outside US mega-caps, “earnings yields” look less stretched versus history and in many places valuations have improved relative to last year. Second, for mega-cap tech, 5-year forward earnings yields also look quite reasonable versus forward real bond returns if the expected growth proﬁles can be delivered. Third, parts of the cyclical universe, including energy, offer attractive earnings yields if we are right that the growth proﬁle for each area holds up, since they are implicitly discounting signiﬁcant declines in earnings going forward. Fourth, dispersion is likely to remain high and focus on company “alpha” may continue to be rewarded. It is probably hard for all these arguments to be true simultaneously. Aggregation constraints mean that higher expected growth in the largest US companies may come at the expense of others, implying that their valuations should be lower. We think that in a “higher for longer” world, strong balance sheet companies and larger companies probably still have scope to extend their outperformance on average. This leaves us favouring a barbell with some exposure to the US mega-caps alongside exposure to some of the more beaten-down cyclical areas. \n",
